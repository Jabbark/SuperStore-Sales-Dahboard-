OVERVIEW: 
In this Power BI Interactive dashboard, the focus is on Super Store Sales Analytics. The dashboard presents key sales indicators, including Total Sales, Sales by Payment Mode, and Sum of Sales by Segment. With just a few clicks, users can delve into specific insights such as Monthly Profit, Monthly Sales, Sales by Ship Mode, Sales by Category, and Sales by Sub-Category. This dashboard serves as a potent tool for decision-makers to gain insights and formulate effective strategies for optimizing sales operations and maximizing overall revenue. The creation process involved importing, cleaning, and processing sales data, designing a dynamic dashboard with advanced charts and maps, implementing filters and slicers for user-friendly exploration. I utilized DAX queries and data analysis for comprehensive sales forecasting, and creating dynamic tables using DAX to enhance data interactivity and analysis capabilities.
